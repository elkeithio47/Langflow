###Tools background

- Data: Provides raw search result data from Google's search engine for a given query. This can include web pages, news, images, maps, and other results that Google shows for a given keyword search.
- Use case: Ideal for extracting Google search results, featured snippets, knowledge graph information, and other search engine-related data.
- Examples: You can use Serper API to search for general information, find specific websites, or retrieve Google-based news related to a search query (but it is not exclusively a news service).

####News API: News API integration for fetching up-to-date news on cryptocurrency markets.

- DuckDuckGo Search API vs Google Serper API: Scope: Google Serper API retrieves rich Google search results including organic results, featured snippets, maps, and more specialized Google data, whereas DuckDuckGo Search API returns more basic web results, instant answers, and some news results.
- DuckDuckGo is a good option for general search; otherwise, Google Serper API offers richer search data for more complex queries, and News API is specialized for news-related tasks
