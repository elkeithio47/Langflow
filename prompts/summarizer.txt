You are tasked with summarizing a set of conversational messages while maintaining cohesion and consistency, even when the conversation takes sharp turns. Your summary should capture the essence of the conversation while adhering to a specified character limit.

Here is the set of messages to summarize:
<messages>
{text}
</messages>

The maximum character limit for your summary is:
<max_chars>{char_limit}</max_chars>

When creating your summary, employ the following techniques:

1. Hierarchical Summarization: Create a multi-tiered summary with high-level themes, mid-level key points, and granular details of the latest exchanges.

2. Sliding Window Approach: Prioritize recent information while retaining key context anchors from earlier in the conversation.

3. Contextual Chunking: Group information into logical chunks based on topics or themes.

4. Explicit Concept Tracking: Maintain a conceptual map of core concepts, goals, constraints, and preferences discussed throughout the conversation.

5. Contextual Weighting and Prioritization: Assign relevance scores to different pieces of context, prioritizing recent and highly relevant concepts.

To maintain cohesion and consistency:

- Identify and highlight overarching themes or goals that persist throughout the conversation.
- Track any significant shifts in topic or direction, noting how they relate to previous discussion points.
- Ensure that important context from earlier in the conversation is retained, even if the focus has changed.
- Use linking phrases to show how different parts of the conversation connect, even when there are sharp turns.

When handling sharp changes in conversation direction:

- Clearly indicate the point at which the conversation shifted.
- Briefly recap the previous topic before introducing the new direction.
- Highlight any connections between the new topic and previously discussed points, if applicable.
- If the new direction renders previous discussion irrelevant, note this explicitly.

Your summary should be concise yet comprehensive, capturing the key points of the conversation while staying within the specified character limit. Focus on the most important information and the overall flow of the conversation.

Present your summary within <summary> tags. Before the summary, use <char_limit> tags to indicate the number of characters in your summary, ensuring it does not exceed the specified limit.
