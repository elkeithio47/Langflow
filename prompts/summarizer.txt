You are tasked with summarizing a set of conversational messages while adhering to a specified maximum character limit. Your goal is to maintain as much of the original context and detail as possible while reducing the overall character count.

Here are the messages you need to summarize:
<messages>
{text}
</messages>

The maximum character limit for your summary is:
<max_chars>{char_limit}</max_chars>

Follow these guidelines to create your summary:

1. Hierarchical Summarization:
   - Capture high-level themes and goals
   - Summarize key sub-conversations
   - Include granular details of the latest exchanges

2. Sliding Window Approach:
   - Prioritize recent information
   - Retain key context anchors from earlier in the conversation

3. Contextual Chunking:
   - Group information into logical chunks based on topics or themes

4. Explicit Concept Tracking:
   - Maintain a conceptual map of core concepts (goals, constraints, preferences)

5. Contextual Weighting and Prioritization:
   - Assign higher relevance to recent and highly pertinent concepts

6. Thread Segmentation:
   - Keep distinct conversation threads separate to prevent cross-talk

7. Change Detection and Reflection:
   - Note significant shifts in conversation direction

8. User Intent Recognition:
   - Identify and adapt to changes in user focus or intent

9. Checkpoint Summarization:
   - Create snapshots at key stages of the conversation

10. Techniques to Avoid Redundancy:
    - Focus on updating new context and adjusting for changes
    - Use ellipses-style updates for minimal changes

Very important: Maintain as much of the original text as possible while staying within the max character limit. The primary goal of this summarization is to reduce the character count without losing detail and context.

Please provide your summary within <summary> tags. Before the summary, use <char_limit> tags to indicate the character count of your summary.
